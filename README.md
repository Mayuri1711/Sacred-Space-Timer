## **Inspiration**

In a world filled with noise and digital clutter, we craved a moment of intentional stillness—a digital sanctuary where users could simply breathe, reflect, and reset. The idea was to create a calming space that felt sacred, meditative, and meaningful, yet built with pure simplicity.

## **What it does**

**Sacred Space Timer** invites users to type a short intention and choose a duration (1–10 minutes). Upon starting, a soft gong sounds, the screen fades to darkness, and a flickering candle or incense animation plays. The entire interface disappears—leaving only the animation. At the end, another gong chimes, the user’s intention reappears with a randomly chosen calming quote, gently closing the session.

## **How we built it (in one prompt)**

We used a **single prompt to ChatGPT** to generate the entire fullscreen, offline-friendly web app using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. No libraries. No frameworks. No backend. The prompt described the desired experience in natural language, and the AI delivered a fully functional meditative timer with:

* Clean UI
* Offline audio playback
* Gentle animations
* Randomized quotes
* Fully responsive, fullscreen layout

All assets were embedded or base64 encoded to ensure true offline capability.

## **Challenges we ran into**

The challenge was philosophical: could a single, well-crafted prompt communicate not just UI structure, but emotional tone, pacing, and sensory aesthetics? Would the result feel sacred and intentional—or merely functional?

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

* **One prompt. One build.** A full meditative experience generated from a single interaction.
* Created something calming and emotionally resonant using only core web tech.
* Designed an experience that encourages presence and mindfulness, not productivity.

## **What we learned**

* A single prompt, when thoughtfully crafted, can yield surprisingly complete and beautiful results.
* The emotional tone of a digital space can be guided by careful prompt writing, not just code.
* Constraints (like no frameworks or backends) can sharpen creativity.
